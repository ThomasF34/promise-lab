# Promise Lab in TypeScript

Welcome in this Promise lab.

You'll discover the so-called Promise mechanism in TypeScript.

The structure is quite self-explanatory. In each set of exercises you will find an `answers.ts` file in which you will have to implement your answer for each function. A file `answer.test.ts` will be useful to test your answers.

For each exercise, you have a script that can be executed to see if you have successed or not. Simply run `npm run <name_of_the_exercice>` where the name is one of the following:

- [01-creating-promises](/01-creating-promises/)
- [02-using-promises](/02-using-promises/)
- [03-chaining-promises](/03-chaining-promises/)
- [04-further-usage](/04-further-usage/)
