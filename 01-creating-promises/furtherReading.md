## Some other ways to resolve of reject

In the Promise API you have access to different constructors that may help you with syntax:
- `Promise.resolve(<optional_output>)` [:point_right: See documentation :point_left:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/resolve)
- `Promise.reject(<optional_output>)` [:point_right: See documentation :point_left:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject)

In the Promise API you have access to different constructor that may help you with particular use-cases:

- `Promise.all(<array_of_promises>)` [:point_right: See documentation :point_left:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)
- `Promise.race(<array_of_promises>)` [:point_right: See documentation :point_left:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)
- `Promise.allSettled(<array_of_promises>)` [:point_right: See documentation :point_left:](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)
